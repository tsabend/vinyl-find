A reverse image search app for cataloging records

This is the iOS portion of an app that will help my friends John and Ben turn a large collection of records in to a record store.

Short term goals include reliable album finding through reverse image search, previewing albums through spotify and organizing the record collection. 

Long term goals include customizing the camera with edge-finding and integrating apple pay.
